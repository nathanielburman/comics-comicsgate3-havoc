Polaris, let your father know that Death awarded me with Death's Mask.

My Oracle mentions:
In more recent history, death masks were also created for notable individuals. For instance, the death mask of Napoleon Bonaparte was made after his death in 1821. It became a significant artifact associated with his legacy.

The idea of an invisible death mask, as you mentioned in your comic book story, adds an intriguing and mystical element to the concept. By making the mask visible only in another dimension and allowing only Death to perceive it, you introduce a unique twist that emphasizes Death's connection to the afterlife and the spiritual realm.

This invisible death mask could possess special powers or significance within your story, such as granting the wearer insight into the realm of the dead or providing protection from supernatural forces. It could also symbolize a deeper connection between Death and the protagonist, creating an interesting dynamic and potentially driving the narrative forward.

Remember, as an author, you have the creative freedom to shape and expand upon existing concepts to suit your story's needs. Feel free to incorporate elements from history and mythology while adding your unique twist to create a compelling narrative.

I trust them to keep time. The dead keep time and the living take more time. Chronos has a lot to do with the situation we are in.
